# React Native Coding Challenge
### Time cap: 5 hours
### API Root: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com

we want you to create a react web application. You will have to make decisions on what to
focus on, but we value complete features over a multitude of partial functionality.
Create a React app with a simple album list, photo list and photo details:
  - Landing page that displays a list of albums
  - Clicking an individual album should navigate to/display said album details and
thumbnails of all picture contained within
  - Clicking an individual picture will navigate to/display its details and said image.

All UI decisions are up to you, but we recommend you spend your time getting things to a
passable point versus making things “beautiful”. We are evaluating this project more on the
technical merits than design. Feel free to pull in any packages you deem necessary. Please
spend no more than 5 hours on this project.

### Bonus Items/focus areas we would like to see:
If you finish up the core app, these are the things we would love to see some portion of
  - Redux integration
  - Session caching of api calls
  - A favorite button for each picture stored on the browser client to show if a user has
‘favorited’ a photo
  - Routing integration with a popular routing library (we use react-router v4 currently)
  - SASS integration
  - Babel integration with es6/es7 common coding paterns
